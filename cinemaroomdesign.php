                    <p class="text-white sub-text px-lg-0 rm_para"> With a primary focus on the audio, visual and décor
                        elements, it is easy to understand why many private home cinema buyers tend to overlook an
                        absolutely essential element to their viewing experience - home cinema seating. The importance
                        of cinema chairs, sofas and other seating options for your home cinema project should certainly
                        not be underestimated.
                        we will advise on the best home cinema seating options, including the number of seats and
                        placement, and guide you through the process of designing an exceptional home theatre.</p>

                    <p class="text-white sub-text px-lg-0 rm_para"> Nothing says “the film is about to start” quite like seeing
                        those lights dim as you are enveloped in darkness – an effect your home cinema can replicate.
                        While too much light trickling through can be distracting, too little light can obscure the
                        on-screen resolution. We can tip the scales to just the right effect.</p>
